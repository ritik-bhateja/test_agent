Sentra – Banking Chatbot UI Requirements

Build a banking-focused AI chatbot UI named Sentra.
The entire app should use dark mode with a clean, professional, modern look.

There is no backend work required. Assume an API already exists.

Login Page

Create a login screen in dark mode.

Any username and password should work for now (no validation needed).

After login, take the user to the main chatbot screen.

Chat Interface Requirements

The chatbot should prompt users to type natural-language queries (e.g., “sales by region last quarter”).

On submit, send the text to the backend API using this payload:

{"user_query": "<user text>"}


The backend will always respond with JSON containing:

type → bar / line / pie / scatter / text

data → either a list of dictionaries OR a simple text string

explanation → text explaining the returned data

Response Handling

(1) If data is a list of dictionaries:

Example:

{
  "type": "bar",
  "data": [
    {"label": "India", "value": "25"},
    {"label": "America", "value": "29"},
    {"label": "Africa", "value": "21"}
  ],
  "explanation": "sample_text"
}


Front-end behavior:

Render the correct chart based on “type”.

Use one charting library only (pick from Recharts, Chart.js, or ECharts).

Show chart plus the explanation text.

Add a toggle that switches between:

Chart view

Table view (showing the label/value rows)

Provide a short trend summary or suggestions along with the explanation.

(2) If data is simple text:

Example:

{
  "type": "text",
  "data": "123",
  "explanation": "sample_text"
}


Front-end behavior:

Do NOT show a chart.

Only display the explanation in the chat.

State & Session

Store each chat session in localStorage so the conversation is preserved after reload.

Load the saved chat history when the user revisits the app.

Extra Improvements (Optional but Recommended)

Add typing animation for chatbot replies.

Show loading indicators while waiting for API response.

Allow message resend on error.

Add a left sidebar to show past sessions or saved queries.

Make the UI responsive for desktop + mobile.
